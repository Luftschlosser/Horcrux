# Project Horcrux

The goal of this project is to create an artifact of dark magic which harvests your body's energy.
It will use this energy to give life to itself and even communicate on a primitive level.
Beware, it may not be created or controlled by muggles!

## Functional Ideas

* LED
  * Just a glowing crystal or eye
  * A flickering/pulsing crystal or eye
  * Sending a small message as morse-code (for example a passphrase to open the locket)
  * change color depending on skin temperature or humidity (aka "mood")
* Motor
  * Load Capacitor over a long time, trigger rumble-motor when charged.
